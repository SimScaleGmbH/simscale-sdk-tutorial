SimScale SDK Tutorial
=====================

*Welcome to the tutorial for the SimScale SDK!*

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a first-touch introduction to the SimScale SDK,
with a hands-on approach and practical examples.

The SimScale SDK offers API access to the SimScale simulation platform, with

`C# <https://github.com/SimScaleGmbH/simscale-csharp-sdk>`_ libraries available. 

With the SDK library, the user can automate tasks to create, run and postprocess physics 
simulations with FEA, CFD and LBM methods.
